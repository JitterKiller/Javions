# Javions

## Project Description

The Javions project aims to develop a program capable of decoding ADS-B messages received by a software-defined radio (SDR) and displaying the aircraft on a map. The project uses the AirSpy R2 SDR to capture messages from various aircraft, which are then processed and visualized. The application is built using Java and CSS.

## Features

- Decode ADS-B messages from aircraft.
- Display aircraft on a map interface.
- Real-time data visualization.
- Interact with the map to zoom and pan.

## Language Composition

- **Java**: 99.7%
- **CSS**: 0.3%

## Additional Information

For optimal message reception, place the SDR antenna in a high, unobstructed location. The project is limited to aircraft within a few hundred kilometers due to the Earth's curvature. The project does not interact with external ADS-B data collection sites.
